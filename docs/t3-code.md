# T3 Code

Camellya and Kafka run the T3 Code server as the `t3` user on port 3773, with its home in `/var/lib/t3`. Lingering starts it at boot. The firewall restricts it to the same trusted subnets as SSH; Kafka also requires a trusted NetworkManager connection. `t3` is a system account, so the login screen does not list it.

The `t3` user has its own Claude Code and Codex logins. It is not in `wheel`, cannot read Carmilla's home or `/persist/nix-config`, and cannot sign commits. Agents can still read files that are world-readable, use the network, and build with Nix.

Carmilla's desktop app is a client of the server. A rebuild keeps the app's local environment off, because that would run agents as Carmilla. The app's native folder picker is off in this mode.

## Setup

Quit the app and switch from a normal terminal. Package updates restart the service and interrupt its agents, and an open app can undo its settings when it closes. Threads from the earlier server under Carmilla's `~/.t3` stay there; the `t3` server starts empty.

Open a shell as `t3`:

```sh
doas machinectl shell t3@
```

In that shell:

1. Log in with `claude` and `codex login`.
2. Clone the repositories agents work on into `t3`'s home.
3. Run `t3 pair` and note the token.

Pair the app as Carmilla once on each host. Use the loopback address, because the LAN address in the printed link changes between networks:

```sh
t3code-desktop "t3code://pair?pairingUrl=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A3773%2Fpair%23token%3D<token>"
```

Then add the cloned repositories as projects in the app. Check the service with `doas systemctl --user -M t3@ status t3code` and its logs with `doas journalctl _SYSTEMD_USER_UNIT=t3code.service`.
